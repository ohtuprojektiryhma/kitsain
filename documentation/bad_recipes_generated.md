## Bad recipes generated by OpenAI API

Examples of bad recipe generation, to use in order to improve the promt, and avoid these in the future.

### Known problems

- Sometimes ingredient amounts appear in the key and the value

### Examples

**Request:**

```json
{
    "pantry": ["lentils", "apple", "soy sauce", "rice", "broccoli"],
    "recipe_type": "vegan",
    "required_items" : ["oats", "kidney beans", "artichoke", "vegan aoili", "pizza dough"],
    "special_supplies" : ["pressure cooker", "blender", "pizza stone"],
    "pantry_only" : false,
    "language" : "englanti"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "ingredients": {
    "apple": "1",
    "artichoke": "1",
    "broccoli": "1 head",
    "kidney beans": "200g",
    "lentils": "100g",
    "oats": "150g",
    "pizza dough": "1 portion",
    "rice": "100g",
    "soy sauce": "30ml",
    "vegan aoili": "50ml"
  },
  "instructions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven with a pizza stone inside to 220\u00b0C.",
    "2. Cook the oats according to package instructions and set aside.",
    "3. In a pressure cooker, combine cooked kidney beans, chopped artichoke hearts, and vegan aoili. Cook on high pressure for 10 minutes.",
    "4. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface.",
    "5. Spread the cooked oats on the pizza dough, followed by the cooked kidney beans and artichoke mixture.",
    "6. Bake the pizza on the preheated pizza stone for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.",
    "7. In a blender, blend together cooked lentils, apple, soy sauce, and a splash of water to make a sauce.",
    "8. Steam the rice and broccoli.",
    "9. Serve the pizza with the lentil sauce on the side, and enjoy!"
  ],
  "recipe_name": "Vegan Artichoke and Kidney Bean Pizza"
}
```

**Problems:**

- Does not sound appealing (cooked oats as the sauce, when could have added tomato sauce)
- Cooking time way too long for a pizza stone
- Rice and broccoli are steamed, but never used in the recipe otherwise, could have just been left out, since they were not in the required items
